Steve Koscho Projects

These are a few projects I have done.

The first two projects came from UW Master's program online.

The third project (Encrypt1) I wrote because I was studying Encryption and
wanted to learn more about it by writing an app.

P2App -
    This application is project #3 in the UW PMP Distributed Systems course

timeproj -
    This application is project #1 in the UW PMP Distributed Systems course

Encrypt1 -
    Takes a folder as input and encrypts each file
    Saves the resulting encrypted data and its key in the output tree
    Each key is written to a file and encrypted with the master key
    Master key is derived from password

tictactoe -
    C++ program I wrote as part of a job interview in 2007

Note: I found the UW PMP online.  I did not take the class.  I watched the
lectures online and did 2 of the projects.
